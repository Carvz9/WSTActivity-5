                <h2>Vyse</h2>
                <p>
                    Metallic mastermind Vyse unleashes her liquid metal abilities with unmatched precision, manipulating the battlefield to her advantage. She can create deadly traps, ensnaring enemies and leaving them vulnerable while controlling the flow of combat. Through her cunning strategies and ruthless manipulation, she forces all who dare to oppose her to rethink their every move, instilling fear and uncertainty with each calculated strike. Her presence on the battlefield is not just powerful—it is psychological, breaking the morale of her enemies before they even have a chance to fight back. Every engagement becomes a test of wits and skill, as Vyse bends the rules of combat to her will, turning chaos into her ultimate weapon.

                <h2>Omen</h2>
                <p>
                    A phantom of a memory, Omen moves silently through the shadows, his presence barely perceptible yet unnervingly constant. With his ability to shroud the battlefield in darkness and render enemies blind, he disrupts their focus and forces them to question every corner and corridor. Teleporting unpredictably across the field, he appears where least expected, turning every engagement into a test of nerves and awareness. As his foes scramble to anticipate his next move, paranoia creeps in, slowing their reactions and clouding their judgment. Omen is not just a fighter—he is an embodiment of fear itself, a mysterious force that manipulates both sight and mind. Every encounter with him is a psychological game, where survival depends on anticipation, strategy, and the courage to face the unseen.
